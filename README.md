# Gender-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Gender detection is one of the popular computer vision applications. When you use a camera to detect a personâ€™s gender instead of detecting it on a picture, it can be said to be a real-time gender detection system.

Two methods are Explained in this repository. One method uses only the opencv-python and cvlib libraries for detecting the gender of the person in real time. The other one uses Caffe models for gender and age detection in real time. Caffe models are pretrained models used for detection.

Feel free to mail me for the caffe models used for training & detection
